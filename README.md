# SNHU CS-230: Operating Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

	This software design template was created for a client, “The Gaming Room”, who wanted a web-based game application created for them. The goal of the game is for teams to guess what an image being “drawn” to the screen is. The image being drawn is slowly rendered to the screen over a 30-second period and is randomly  pulled from a library of 200 images. The client required that only one instance of the game be running in memory at once and that the game and team names are unique in order to not use a name already in use. The game has the ability to have one or more teams playing and the teams are able to have many players assigned to them. The client also required that the game is able to run across multiple platforms, such as Mac, Windows, and Linux and able to communicate to each other as a game is running.  
	
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

	I feel that while designing this document I did well in the overall description of the final recommendations for the client. The recommendations are an incredibly important section because they take all previous data presented in the document and provide a justified reasoning as to they best potential way to go about the creation of the application. 
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

	Working through a design document such as this one helped me with developing the code because it laid out a linear process to follow. While not every aspect of application design may follow a strict linear path, having a design document to help guide the overall process of creating the application helps keep the end product result in mind as the application code is developed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

	If I were to revise one part of my work in this document I would choose to revise the “Evaluations” section. While I do have a good overall understanding of the four major operating platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows, Mobile), I believe that I could improve my overall understanding of their underlying architecture. Studying the more complex aspects of these operating platforms would allow me to improve my overall understanding, and evaluation, of these platforms which would translate into a better-informed design document.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

	The user is just as important to consider as the client is in many aspects when developing an application. The user may be using a particular operating platform which needs to be considered when designing the application, so the user feels that the app was designed with them in mind. This also ensures that there are no issues with compatibility for users of a particular operating system. Another important user needs is ease of use when interacting with the application. The game needs to seamlessly interact with many other users and provide a smooth feeling application. Allowing the user to perform important functions of the application is critical for user interaction and overall satisfaction. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

	The design of this application was focused on understanding the architecture that the app would be operating on and the requirements that the client had for the applications functionality. A technique that I will use in the future analysis and design of a similar software app will focus on what the end function of the app should be. Having an end result in mind is an effective way to guide the design and stay focused on the apps end purpose.
